# School Record System
This is a school record system that keeps records of students’ examination results and
personal information. It was coded in python with integration of databases in
MySQL. 

Records can be created, deleted or edited by administrators by entering the
students’ information and relevant examination information. A table named
‘STUDENTS’ is made. It stores the information entered by the user such as the roll
number, name of student, contact information and examination data. Users can read
the pre-existing records by entering their data.
